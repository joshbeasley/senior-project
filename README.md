**Abstract:** Passwords have become the ubiquitous method of online authentication in the modern digital age, yet their flawed nature leaves them open to many security concerns. This project explores the applications of deep learning to password cracking and password security, specifically, by analyzing the way in which the dictionary of likely passwords is constructed for a conventional dictionary attack. Current state-of-the-art password cracking tools like John the Ripper and HashCat rely on a rule-based approach to apply transformations to the existing dictionary and expand its size. I aim to develop and experiment with the effectiveness of various deep learning techniques including recurrent neural networks, generative adversarial networks, and variational autoencoders to test their effectiveness in learning the underlying structure of a leaked password dataset. These models can then be used to expand the size of existing password dictionaries to improve password cracking ability, and in turn, increase password security when users are tasked with creating a password.

## Overview of Repository

The repo contains four main directories: **datasets, passwordGAN, passwordLSTM, and passwordVAE**

The datasets directory contains all of the datasets used in this project for training and testing the neural networks

The models directories each contain a class with all relevant functions for the model, while the test file creates an ArgParse and an instance of the class to train and test from the command line

## Setup

`git clone https://github.com/joshbeasley/senior-thesis.git`

All packages and their corresponding versions are located in the `requirements.txt` file.
Install all packages in your desired conda or venv python environment and you should be good to go!
